# Libraries and frameworks used

Some really cool external libraries and frameworks make this project actually possible and I want to thank the people who have spend their time writing them:

* Doctrine
* Symfony
* The entity audit bundle from Simplethings
* Whoops from filp
* Smarty
* ADLDAP2
* IP-Lib from mlocati
* php-ip from rlanvin
* iptools from s1lentium

Thank you all for contributing them to the opensource community.
